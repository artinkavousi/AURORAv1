# Flow

This is a realtime MLS-MPM simulation, running in the browser using the three.js WebGPURenderer.

It started as an implementation of MLS-MPM guided by [matsuoka-601](https://github.com/matsuoka-601)'s great [WebGPU-Ocean](https://github.com/matsuoka-601/WebGPU-Ocean) repo. Then the particle dynamics started to remind me of [Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/)'s digital artworks, so I started to emulate his style instead of trying to render water.

See it running live [here](https://holtsetio.com/lab/flow/)!
